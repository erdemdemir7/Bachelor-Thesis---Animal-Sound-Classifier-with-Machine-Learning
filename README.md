# Bachelor-Thesis---Animal-Sound-Classifier-with-Machine-Learning
This project aims to provide animal sound classifier research tool for researchers by using Machine Learning algorithms in Python to help researchers who need classification and clustering results however having limited coding skills. My program takes labelled or unlabelled input audio dataset on the user-friendly GUI, extracts the MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) features of the input audio data. Subsequently, depending on the input parameter type and preferences taken from GUI, the classifier processes the given audio data then displays results and metrics on the GUI.
